# 🎉 Welcome to the Demo Evershop Test Framework! 🎉

Created an end-to-end test automation framework for the SauceDemo eCommerce website using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG. The framework follows the Page Object Model (POM) for clean, maintainable code and automates key scenarios such as login, search products, select random products, check products total price, cart management, and checkout.

This framework is designed for robust automation testing using **Java**. It includes:
- **Selenium** for browser automation
- **JUnit** and **TestNG** for structured test management
- **Allure Reporting** for insightful test reports
- **Error Screenshots** and more to streamline testing!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up a Maven Project
   - Create a Maven project as usual or set it up from scratch.

### 2. Configure `pom.xml`
   - Add the provided dependencies and plugins in your `pom.xml` file.

### 3. Create Folder Structure
   - Go to `src/test/java` and create these folders:
     - `pages`
     - `utilities`
     - `tests`

### 4. Import Files
   - Option 1: Import each file manually into the corresponding folders.
   - Option 2: Download the complete `src/test/java` folder and replace it in your project.

### 5. Configure the Driver Path
   - A `drivers` folder is included with Chrome, Edge, and Firefox drivers.
   - Set the driver path in `BaseTest.java` as shown below:
     ```java
     System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "drivers/chromedriver.exe");
     ```
   - Or, if using Selenium 4+, use:
     ```java
     WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
     ```

### 6. Add `testing.xml`
   - Download `testing.xml` and place it in your project directory to manage test execution.

### 7. Run Your Tests 🚦
   - Save your project and run it. The `allure-report` and `screenshot` folders will be generated automatically during test execution.

---

### 8. **Generate Allure HTML Report**  
   - Run the following command to serve the Allure report:  
     ```bash
     allure serve <path_to_allure_results>
     ```
   - Alternatively, navigate to the `allure-report` folder in your file explorer, open a command prompt from that location, and then use:  
     ```bash
     allure serve
     ```

Enjoy using the SuccessDemo Test Framework!
